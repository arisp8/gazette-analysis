# Gazette Analysis
A tool used to analyze the issues posted by the Official Greek Government's Gazette (FEK - ΦΕΚ).

## Goal
The main aim of this application is to analyze all government issued laws, regulations and bylaws in order to determine cases
in which 2 (or more) Greek ministries are co-signing a big percentage of aforementioned legislation and thus we could computationally 
and statistically find ministries where a merger of sorts would be beneficial.
